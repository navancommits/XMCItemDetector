# XMCItemDetector

The package is not attached to the sln
So, for now, you need Visual Studio 2022 Community Edition

There is a sample XMCItemDetector.txt that should have the env name, env url, sc api key ,Experience Edge Endpoint and EdgeApiKey

The entries in one line must be separated by a single space as in the example file

Once you have the proper env details in the file and build the VS project, the txt file must be placed in the same location as the generated exe file and then you are all set to detect!
